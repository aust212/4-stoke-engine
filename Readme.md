# Piston Model
This project showcases a 3D piston model created using AutoCAD for precise technical drafting and Blender for texturing, materials, lighting, and final rendering. It's a demonstration of mechanical design fundamentals, CAD accuracy, and 3D visualization skills.

## Tools Used
- Autocad - Technical drawing, dimensions, and model design
- Blender - Material setup, environment lighting, and rendering

## Project Features
- Fully modeled piston with accurate proportions
- Realistic materials and lighting for final render
