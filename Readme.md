# QuadMotion Engine Assembly
A 4-Piston Crankshaft System, Designed in AutoCAD, Rendered in Blender

## Overview

QuadMotion Engine Assembly is a mechanically accurate 4-piston crankshaft system, modeled from scratch using AutoCAD for precision drafting and Blender for material work, animation, and final rendering.

This project demonstrates:
- Mechanical design fundamentals
- CAD accuracy
- Realistic 3D visualization

## Tools Used
- AutoCAD: Technical drawing, dimensioning, and modeling
- Blender — Materials and rendering

## Purpose
This project highlights my ability to design and visualize mechanical assemblies, bridging engineering precision with 3D artistry.
